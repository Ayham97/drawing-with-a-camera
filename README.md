# drawing-with-a-camera
for it to work you need a good enviroment with good lights to detect the pen and the shadow.
i tested it in a closed room with the lights off and a lamp.

keys are:
z : detect pen.
c : to choose point for corner
q : exit
l : clean
r : draw rectangle choose center and then radios
